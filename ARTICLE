Using CHDL as a PCB-level HDL
-----------------------------

It may come as no surprise to anybody who has used any of the CHDL-related
projects, but I don't like to use schematics. My notebooks are full of little
pieces of them, sure, but when it comes to actually representing designs in
human-and-machine-readable fashion, I find schematics to be intrinsically
inferior to easily-customizable textual representations.
